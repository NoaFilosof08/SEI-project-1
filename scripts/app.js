// CREATE AN OUTLINE  - this will encompass all the different needs of the JS: 
  // DOM elements: what is to be caputered from HTML
  // GIRD variables: what will reference the grid: declare these so that they can be changed further down the line if needed
  // GAME variables: moving elements on the screen e.g. aliens will be declared here
  // Functions: both event functions and logic functions here; first one to create will be the button click (to start the game) and creation of the grid 
    // button click: this will set off a timer and 'start' the game (start game function first will work on timer later)
    // create grid: use the grid variables to create a for loop which will append the grid to the child (cells) and also push into an array - this will also greate an element called 'div' which will be styled in css for sizing
  // EVENT listeners - make most of these later - but these will listen out for start button, and key movements on keyboard (space, left/right arrows)

  // * DOM ELEMENTS


  // * GRID VARIABLES
